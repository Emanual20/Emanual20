<!-- ### Q&A ðŸ‘‹

Q1: Why your name @Emanual20?

A1: Well, my nickname in Github community is @Emanual20. I will tell u a story that I dream to be a wise man whose knowledge is more than an e-manual, sounds like an e-book or a dictionary maybe? **Well, that's not true.** I just mispell the word Emanuel which is the family name of the basketball player Emanuel Ginobili played for San-antonio Spurs who is very famous in his whole career. He's my hero in my high school period, as feeling so sorry about mispelling that. -->
